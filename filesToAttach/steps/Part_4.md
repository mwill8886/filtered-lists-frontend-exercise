# Part 4:

Add a `<select />` tag that lets you change the sort order between "name" (alphabetical), "population" (descending order), or "squareMiles" (descending order). It should only sort the states that match the current search term.

For example, when the US is selected:
- Filtering by "dE" and sorting by square miles should show Delaware then Rhode Island
- Filtering by "X" and sorting by population should show Texas then New Mexico
