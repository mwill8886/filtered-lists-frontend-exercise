# Part 2:

Add a search box to your app using an `<input type="text" />` tag. The search box will filter the list of states so that you only see states whose name contains the input's value as a substring. This search should **not** be case sensitive. If there is no search string in the input, then it should display all of the states.

For example:
- "Ca" in the search box should only return California, North Carolina, and South Carolina
- "iNg" in the search box should only return Washington and Wyoming
