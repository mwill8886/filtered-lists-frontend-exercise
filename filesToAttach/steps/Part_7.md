# Part 7:

Create a file `StateList.test.tsx`. In this file, using comments, document a few of the tests you would write to ensure confidence in this component. Then, choose one of the tests that you feel has a good balance of usefulness and ease of implementation and implement it using React Testing Library. So that all tests pass when running `npm run test`, you should delete the `App.test.tsx` file that was generated by Create React App.
